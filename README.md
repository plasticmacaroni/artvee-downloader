# artvee-downloader
An incredibly simple (read: fragile) script to download Artvee user collections. 

To use it, create an account, and make a collection (visible under your profile page). 

You'll need to enter your login and password into the script once, and it will remember them. 

Then, when you want to download a collection you've made, submit the collection URL into the tool. It'll download each collection into its own folder.
